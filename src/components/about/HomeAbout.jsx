          has quickly grown to become a powerful organization with 31 active
          members who are dedicated to upholding their purpose of uplifting
          underprivileged communities. Their effective completion of five events
          throughout their 2022â€“2023 reign is evidence of their commitment to
          bringing about constructive change.
