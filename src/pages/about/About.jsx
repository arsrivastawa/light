                Since its founding in May 2021 with just nine members, LiGHT
                Sindri has quickly grown to become a powerful organization with
                31 active members who are dedicated to upholding their purpose
                of uplifting underprivileged communities. Their effective
                completion of five events throughout their 2022â€“2023 reign is
                evidence of their commitment to bringing about constructive
                change. LiGHT Sindri is now prepared to start a new chapter of
                influence and expansion as they look forward to the future with
                great anticipation. They want to further establish themselves as
                an independent hub committed to promoting a better, more
                inclusive society, and they have big aspirations for the Sindri
                region and beyond. Their story serves as a tribute to the
                strength of group effort and steadfast dedication to changing
                the world.
